# Launch

Index DAO will launch sometime around early January 2022 once the LBE has concluded. The exact launch date will be publicly announced on Twitter and in our Discord server.

We will launch on Avalanche to start due to its high number of existing DAOs which allows our treasury to diversify quickly. Additionally, Avalanche is home to Wonderland which is the second largest DAO after Olympus, and both MEMO and gOHM are available on Avalanche which gives our treasury the opportunity to start off with strong DAO tokens.

However the long term goals of Index are to accept bonds for DAOs cross-chain so in the future Index will be available on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver, etc.
