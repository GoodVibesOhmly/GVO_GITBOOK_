# Stake your INDEX (ðŸ“ˆ,ðŸ“ˆ)

Staking allows you to earn INDEX passively via auto-compounding. By staking your INDEX with Index DAO, you receive sINDEX (staked INDEX) in return at a 1:1 ratio. After that, your sINDEX balance will increase automatically on every epoch based on the current APY.

### How to stake

* Go to the [Stake page of the Index DAO website.](https://app.indexdao.finance/#/stake) Select the "Stake" tab.
* Enter the amount of INDEX that you would like to stake in the input field. If you would like to stake all your INDEX, press the "Max" button and the input field will be populated with all your available INDEX balance.
* Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
* After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Stake" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have staked your INDEX!

## How to unstake

1. Go to the [Stake page of the Index DAO website.](https://app.indexdao.finance/#/stake) Select the "Unstake" tab.
2. Enter the amount of sINDEX that you would like to unstake in the input field. If you would like to unstake all your sINDEX, press the "Max" button and the input field will be populated with all your available sINDEX balance.
3. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
4. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Unstake" and sign the transaction.

_Note: The "Approve" transaction is only needed when staking/unstaking for the first time; subsequent staking/unstaking only requires you to perform the "Stake" or "Unstake" transaction._

## Reading the info

**APY** tells you the annualized rate of return based on the reward yield. It takes into account the effect of compounding since sINDEX rebases exponentially.

**TVL** measures the dollar amount of all the staked INDEX in Index DAO.

**Current Index** allows you to track your gain from staking. The index started from 1 at epoch 0, and increases every epoch. If you staked at genesis (epoch 0) and never unstaked any INDEX, your balance today would be X times greater, where X is the current index. You can use the index to track your position by marking down the index number when you stake and unstake. You divide the index number when you unstake by the index number when you stake to get the ratio by which your sINDEX balance has increased.

**Your Balance** tells you how many unstaked INDEX are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can stake.

**Your Staked Balance** tells you how many staked INDEX are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can unstake.

**Next Rebase** tells you the remaining time until the next rebase.

**Reward Yield** tells you how much your sINDEX balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you stake 100 INDEX and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your sINDEX balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.

**ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your sINDEX balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you stake 100 INDEX and the rate is 8.4577%, your sINDEX balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days.
