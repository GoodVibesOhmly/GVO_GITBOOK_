# Mint your INDEX (üè¶,üè¶)

Minting allow users to mint INDEX from the protocol at a discount by trading it with liquidity (LP tokens) or other assets. The former is called liquidity bonds and the latter reserve bonds.

Minting takes roughly 15 epochs to vest, and INDEX tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. Liquidity bonds help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve bonds allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its RFV faster.

Index DAO offers five types of bonds on its website:

- gOHM bond
- MEMO bond
- MIM bond
- INDEX/MIM LP bond
- A third DAO protocol to be determined by the community

## How to redeem

Go to the [Mint Page](https://app.indexdao.finance/#/mints) and select the bond type you have purchased. Select the "Redeem" tab.
Use the Claim to claim all of your available rewards, and have the pending INDEX sent to your wallet.
Use the Claim and Autostake button to have all the available INDEX sent automatically to the staking contract and receive the sINDEX as a receipt for your stake!

## Sending your rewards to another wallet

You can bond while sending the minted INDEX to another address. This is useful for additional privacy, or for doing multiple mints while the current bonds are still vesting. Note that if the same account holds multiple bonds, the rewards you can claim from the earlier bonds have to be forfeited, so make sure to claim your rewards before minting again. Rewards that were not given to you just yet will not be lost - they will be added to the bond and given to you over a 5 day period.

1.) Go to the [Mint Page](https://app.indexdao.finance/#/mints) and select the bond type you want to purchase to mint INDEX.

2.) Select the amount that you would like to bond, then click on the cogwheel icon at the top right of the page.

3.) The menu will show up. At the Recipient Address field, you can specify a different address that will receive the vested INDEX. By default, it is filled with your current address.

4.) You can also modify the Slippage field to increase or decrease the likelihood of your order getting through. A higher slippage increases that likelihood, but you may get a more undesirable fill price.

5.) Close the menu by clicking the cogwheel icon again.

6.) Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

7.) After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have successfully minted INDEX!
