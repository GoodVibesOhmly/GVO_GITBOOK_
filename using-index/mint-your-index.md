# Mint your INDEX (üè¶,üè¶)

Minting allow users to mint INDEX from the protocol at a discount by trading it with liquidity (LP tokens) or other assets. The former is called liquidity bonds and the latter reserve bonds.

Minting takes roughly 15 epochs to vest, and INDEX tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. Liquidity bonds help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve bonds allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its RFV faster.

Index DAO offers five types of bonds on its website:

- gOHM bond
- wMEMO bond
- MIM bond
- INDEX/gOHM LP bond
- A third DAO protocol to be determined by the community

## How to redeem
