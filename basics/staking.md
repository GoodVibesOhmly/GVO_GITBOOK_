# Staking

## What is staking?

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Index DAO.** Stakers stake their INDEX on [the Index DAO website](https://app.indexdao.finance/#/) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from bond sales, and can vary based on the number of INDEX staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of INDEX translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of INDEX drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked INDEX balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock INDEX and receive an equal amount of sINDEX.** Your sINDEX balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sINDEX is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sINDEX and receive an equal amount of INDEX.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked INDEX (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
