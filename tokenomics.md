# Tokenomics

## Distribution

INDEX will start with a supply of 105,000 INDEX which will be distributed as such:

### Liquidity Bootstrapping Event (52,969 INDEX)

52,969 INDEX were sold during the liquidity bootstrapping event for a total of 310,164 MIM.

### Initial Liquidity (20,000 INDEX)

20,000 INDEX tokens will be paired with 50% of the MIM raised in the Liquidity Bootstrapping Event to create the initial liquidity on TraderJoe.

### Marketing, Partnerships, Airdrops (12,031 INDEX)

12,031 INDEX will be set aside for marketing, strategic partnerships, and airdrops to support the long term growth of Index DAO.

### Development Team (20,000 INDEX)

The Board of Directors will have 20,000 unstaked INDEX vested over the next 6 months to support the long term development of Index DAO. Since these are unstaked INDEX tokens they will not benefit from the rebasing rewards, preventing the Board of Directors from controlling too high of a percentage of INDEX tokens in the future.
